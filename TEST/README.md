# ReLoD: The Remote-Local Distributed System for Real-time Reinforcement Learning on Vision-Based Robotics Tasks

ReLoD uses a wired local and a wireless remote computer to perform real-time learning, an appealing setting for industrial learning systems. It is a generalist RL system for learning with real robots from scratch! 
Check out how ReLoD learns to perform vision-based tasks on UR5 and Roomba (iRobot Create 2):

## Supported Algorithms
- Soft Actor Critic (SAC)
- Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)

N.B: All vision-based experiments use Random Augmented Data (RAD) to improve sample efficiency

## Supported Tasks
- UR5-VisualReacher
- Create-Reacher
- Vector-ChargerDetector

## Installation instructions
1. Download Mujoco and license files to ~/.mujoco
2. Install miniconda or anaconda
3. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
conda create --name myenv python=3.6    # Python 3.6 is necessary
conda activate myenv
```
3. Add the following to ~/.bashrc:
```bash
conda activate myenv
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/home/<username>/.mujoco/mjpro210/bin   # Change based on mujoco version
export MUJOCO_GL="egl"  # System specific
```
and run:
```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```
4. Install packages with:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install .
```
